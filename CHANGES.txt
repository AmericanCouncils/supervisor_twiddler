Next Release

  Fixed a bug in addProcessToGroup() where the process config was
  not added to the group properly.  Thanks to Roger Hoover for 
  noticing this.
  
  The addProcessToGroup() method now supports program definitions
  with numprocs > 1 and will add all resulting processes from the
  program definition.  Requested by Roger Hoover.
  
  Added new method log() that writes an arbitrary message to the 
  main supervisord log.  This is useful for recording information 
  about your twiddling.
